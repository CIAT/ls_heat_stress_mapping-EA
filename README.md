# Heat Stress Mapping

Code for assessing current conditions of heat stress and its trend during the historical (1981-2010) and future periods (2021-2050, 2041-2070, 2071-2100) for dairy cattle, beef cattle, goat, sheep, swine, and poultry in East Africa using an ensemble of 10 GCMs from [CORDEX Africa](https://www.cordex.org/domains/region-5-africa/) projections under RCP 4.5 (intermediate pathway) and RCP 8.5 (most extreme pathway) scenarios. 

This effort is developed by the [International Center for Tropical Agriculture](https://ciat.cgiar.org/) and [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research, Atmospheric Environmental Research](https://www.imk-ifu.kit.edu/).
